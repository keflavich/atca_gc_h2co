Abstract:
We have found a new \formaldehyde \oneone (formaldehyde) maser in the Galactic
Center Cloud C, G0.38+0.04.  At the time of publication, this is the eighth
region containing a \formaldehyde detected in the galaxy.  Cloud C is the only
region of confirmed high-mass star formation along the Galactic Center Ridge,
further confirming that \formaldehyde masers are exclusively associated with high-mass
star formation.


Introduction:

Observations:
ATCA observations were perfomed in 2015 as part of a larger survey.

Analysis:
We detect one narrow line ($\sigma<1.3$ \kms, below the instrument resolution)
at $v=36.7$ \kms with an amplitude of 235 mJy/beam, where the restoring beam is
$4.84\arcsec\times1.49\arcsec$.  This translates to a brightness temperature of
1700 K, which is far brighter than thermal \formaldehyde emission should ever
reach.  It is also unresolved, so this brightness temperature is a lower limit.

The maser line is probably not detectable by single-dish observations.  Cloud C
is part of a dense and extended cloud that is strongly detected in absorption,
either against the CMB or the local background continuum.  This absorption has
a comparable flux density to the emission at the best available single-dish resolution
for CMZ sources ($\sim3\arcmin$).  However, with $\sim1\arcmin$ resolution, the 
emission would still be detectable, so larger dishes, e.g. Arecibo and FAST,
could detect similar sources.  However, extragalactic detections of such weak
masers is extremely unlikely.

Discussion:
Out of the 8 known maser-containing regions in the Galaxy, there are now two in
the Central Molecular Zone.  These two regions, Cloud C and Sgr B2, are the only
dense clouds in the CMZ with known high-mass star formation.  Sgr C also shows
some hints of high-mass star formation \citep{Kendrew2013a}, but it has not yet
been searched for \formaldehyde masers.

This high detection rate within the CMZ, despite limited statistical
information, is suggestive that \formaldehyde masers may be an efficient tracer
of high-mass star formation in extreme environments.
It also raises questions: What is different about CMZ high-mass star formation and
similar star formation in other parts of the galaxy?  Extensive surveys have shown
that the occurrence of \formaldehyde masers in ``normal'' high-mass star
forming regions in the Galaxy is very low, $<2\%$, or 1 of 58 sources in a
large survey \citep{Araya2004a,Araya2007a,Araya2008a}\footnote{In a large unpublished survey
of 400 sources with the GBT, there are no new maser detections}.
